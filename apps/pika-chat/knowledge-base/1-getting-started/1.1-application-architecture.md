# Application Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the pika webapp architecture, explaining how the various components work together.

## High-Level Architecture

TODO: 

## Core Architectural Components

### 2. SvelteKit Web Application (TypeScript/Svelte)

The web application provides:

- User interface
- Application logic
- Data management
- State handling

Key directories:

- `src/routes`: SvelteKit route components
- `src/client`: Client front-end components run in browser
- `src/server`: Server back-end components run on server
- `src/lib/components`: Reusable front-end components
- `src/lib/hooks`: Shared hooks and utilities
- `src/lib/types`: TypeScript type definitions

## Directory Structure

TODO

## Component Organization

Our components are organized into four distinct categories:

### 1. App Components (`lib/client/app/`)

Core application components and state that form the foundation of the application:

- App state management (`app.state.svelte.ts`)


TODO: incomplete


### 2. Feature Components (`lib/client/features/`)

Components specific to individual features, organized by domain:

TODO: incomplete

### 3. Base UI Components (`lib/components/ui/`)

Foundation UI components from shadcn:

- Buttons, inputs, dialogs
- Form elements
- Layout primitives
- Navigation components

### 4. Enhanced UI Components (`lib/components/ui-pika/`)

Custom UI components built on top of base components:

- Enhanced tooltips
- Specialized buttons
- Custom input components
- Application-specific UI patterns

## State Management Architecture

TODO: generate diagram of how state management works


Our state management follows these key principles:

1. **Centralized AppState**: A single root state object accessible via Svelte context
2. **Feature-Specific States**: Each feature has its own state class known as a FeatureState
3. **Lazy Initialization**: FeatureStates are instantiated only when needed
4. **Dependency Injection**: State classes receive dependencies via constructors
5. **Reactive Updates**: Changes to state automatically update the UI

### AppState Access Pattern

```typescript
<script lang="ts">
    import { AppState } from '$client/app/app.state.svelte';
    import { getContext } from 'svelte';

    // Get the AppState from context
    const appState = getContext<AppState>('appState');

    //TODO: show accessing other state objects

    //TODO: show using appState in a component
</script>
```
